# 50 sentences that I find it difficult

1. A pack of wolves were sighted. (I need to pronounce `pack` with a sound, so I don't have much brain power to even say `wolves`, the worst word ever, and `were` comes right after the worst word. When more than two words containing `w` happen in succession, I give up ðŸ˜…)

2. Obviously, she is sitting opposite to me. (Obviously -> a cluster of consonants, bv, that shouldn't exist ðŸ˜‚. After using my brain power for `obviously`, I don't have much left in me to pronounce `opposite`)

3. What did you do differently? (It's the `tl` in `differntly`)

4. I used to play drums in a band called Little Red. (I never be able to say this because `play drums`, `band`, `called` have difficult vowels and `Little Red` is impossible to pronounce.)

5. Play a flat 9 note on the dominant chord. (`flat` and `chord` seem to sound week when I say it. I say this phrase all the time, but never felt right.)

6. You need to know the chord progression you are gonna play a solo over. (`chord progression` and `solo` never felt right. sow-low is double ou?)

7. Let me show you the ways to connect the chord tone. (`chord tone` contains long `o` and `ou` sounds which makes the worst vowel combo word).

8. It's very recognisable.

9. I'm on the back foot.

10. I'm on the different level. (`-fferent` and `vel` are difficult.)

11. My favourite book is 'On the Road' by Jack Kerouac. (`road` is difficult and difficulty increases if there is `the` in front of it)

12. I live dangerously.

13. They are re-releasing the album next month. (re and re back to back, why ðŸ˜­)

14. They did a theatrical re-release due to its popularity. (making it even harder with adding `theatrial` in front of the `re-re` hell)

15. I've been trying it for 30 years (`try`, `th` in 30, and `y` sound in `years`. )

16. I'm growing a chili plant.

17. It's critical to practise different paradiddle patterns every day.

18. I'm bleeding and he's breeding.
